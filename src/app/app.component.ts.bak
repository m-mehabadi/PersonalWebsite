Working with two bachelor students on their final projects, we developed a novel approach that used the perceptron algorithm to find an optimal gradient direction given multiple gradients from different objectives and/or datasets. We implemented the system and wrote a paper documenting our methodology and findings. Though we maintained a GitHub repository for the project, we unfortunately couldn't get the work published due to limitations in our compute capacity for proper evaluation. The project provided valuable insights into gradient manipulation techniques for multi-task learning scenarios.",

I designed a data warehouse solution to simplify access to this complex data structure. The implementation included a RESTful API built with Python and Django, and a client-side application developed with Vue.js 2 (which was all the hype at that time). This project was particularly significant as it represented my work as a full-stack engineer during the final years of my bachelor's degree.",
